Companies may have limited place- income for stocks, production capacity etc. In this project, it
is focused on a multi criteria decision making problem, order prioritization. It is observed that
producing in an amount exceeding production capacity is expected in a specific time period.
Detecting these time intervals have already done in a day of week. Then, delivery date of some
orders needs to be postponed. In order to achieve that, there is going to be developed DSS by
using Excel. Customer satisfaction, making more reliable changes on the dates, improving
planning, reducing costs, ensuring production and sales communications integrity, increasing
brand value and being more accurate about this process are expected gains of this study. To
achieve these goals, possible criterions that can affect the sequencing are collected, analyzed to
get independent- applicable ones. To sequence the orders, AHP method is used to find relative
importance and then using these values after computations, the scores of the orders are found.
These orders are wanted to order because of the excession of capacity art that time interval. So,
designed Excel sheet gives the user a suggestion about this problem. So, delivery date of orders
will be postponed according to this system that is expectation of this study. For integration that

amount of consumption increases. This obligates producers to respond to wide range of product
demands in the competitive market. In this context, the object of the project is to develop a
dynamic production scheduling algorithm that can work according to the changeable demands for
the inner body production unit in the Ar&cedil;elik Dishwasher Plant.<br><br>
The overall problem of the project is to solve the problems in adapting the dynamic
production plans to the production line. Production area has layout that contains parallel montage
lines in two different areas and there are some connections between montage lines. Therefore, we
will need to construct an software algorithm around a mathematical model in which includes
many constraints and time factors. So, integer programing optimization has become one of the
most important methods. In addition, it is expected to use statistical simulation for converging
real capacities of work stations. The literature review is made to obtain a method that could
integrate 2 limits such as minimizing the flow time and short production time. Because of this
reason, integer programming is more appropriate for establishing the goals of the project. The
required data like total stopping time, operation time etc. is analyzed for integrating into
software. The analysis results and obtained values are mentioned in the Analysis and Results
section. The obtained information in Analysis and Results section is used to evaluate more
realistic simulation results. General issues about implementing the project is mentioned in the
Discussions section. As a result of this project, it is expected that the instantaneous integration of
the production plan and the feasible production plan reports will be presented by the software and
this can decrease the amount of scrap and targeted to the high number of OEE with low setup

in inventory are important questions. For automotive assembly processes, from top to bottom,
there are thousands of different parts used in assembly. In T&uuml;rk Trakt&ouml;r, there are large, small,
heavy, light, expensive, cheap parts used in assembly with high variations. As an inventory system,
there are intermediary areas in between main warehouse and assembly lines. Thousands of types
of parts are being stored at those intermediary areas as Work-in-process (WIP) inventories, in
several kinds of containers and with determined levels of inner quantities in those containers.
Because of the difference of demand for each part, high inventory days and shortages occur in
those areas, these cause corruption of some parts and also missing the production tempo, hence
high failed part costs. Decision of these feeding types and inner quantities are determined with
heuristics, in T&uuml;rk Trakt&ouml;r. In this project, a model is presented to support decisions of those
feeding types and inner quantities for each part. By this, it is aimed to have better feeding type and

Receiving area is the starting point of production system and any substantial problem in this area is cumulatively affecting the whole system. The aim of this project is minimizing the cost, redesigning the layout, designing the job descriptions and creating the new system for sorting of the material.<br><br>
Process starts when the materials arrive at the receiving area and finishes when the materials are put in the warehouse. Fundamental problem of this project is that any sorting systems are not occurred in any section of receiving area. This is causing the delay and cost to company. As mentioned before, because of that it is a main problem, the main purpose of this project to solve this problem and integrate the current system. Also layout is the cause of this problem. Receiving area size is not enough, especially in rush-hours, materials are being put outside of the lines or empty spaces and it is creating the complications and materials to be lost, also decreasing the performances of workers. Unedified section area/border is effecting negatively the line formation and knowledge of the material locations. As a result, searching the materials task is taking redundant time and energy of the workers.<br><br>
In order to eliminate these problems of the receiving area, -that are caused by intricacies of the system- first, an algorithm will be developed to sort the in-coming materials, in a certain sequence. This algorithm will be integrated with an ERP system to get the necessary data. To control, that the materials are being processed according to the sequence an automatic identification and data capture system will be used. The layout of the area will be redesigned to better work with the system and a new rack system will be established.

management and product selection for stores. Retailers need to assign limited store space to a
growing number of product categories such that sales and other performance metrics are
maximized. The purpose of this project is to develop a model for product assortment
optimization and space allocation. The model determines the right products to include in a
showroom's assortment and their space percentages in the showroom. As a result of the project
21 products are selected by model to display in Vivense showroom.
